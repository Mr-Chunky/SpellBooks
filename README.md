# SpellBooks

My first completed Android mobile application.  The app is built entirely with Kotlin.


The app is built for users who have trouble keeping track of the physical hard-cover books that they own, and thus end up either buying duplicates or forgetting about them entirely.  It is built on top of a SQLite backend, so multiple users can use the same device to access their content in a segregated fashion, as long as they log in with the appropriate credentials.  A few notable features include the ability for a user to set a goal for the amount of books they'd like to read in a single year as well as the total pages they'd like to read by the end of that year.

## Development Environment

* Android Studio (Chipmunk)
* **Target:** API 23

## Instructions

_Side Note: This app is unreleased._

If you would like to test the application, clone this repository and initialise a new Virtual Device with a minimum API target of 23, or connect a physical device to your machine that has a minimum API of 23.  Run the application and test the features!
