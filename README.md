# SpellBooks
One of my mobile application projects that stems from an assignment during my final year of University.

The app is built for users who have trouble keeping track of the physical hard-cover books that they own, and thus end up either buying duplicates or forgetting about them entirely.  It is built on top of a SQLite backend, so multiple users can use the same device to access their content in a segregated fashion, as long as they log in with the appropriate credentials.  A few notable features include the ability for a user to set a goal for the amount of books they'd like to read in a single year as well as the total pages they'd like to read by the end of that year.

-THIS PROJECT IS STILL BEING UPDATED-

Upcoming features:
* Progress Bar to keep track of the books users have currently read vs their book goal
* Progress Bar to keep track of the pages users have currently read vs their page goal
* Camera functionality to add a custom book image with included permission handling for the first time that the user taps on the camera icon
